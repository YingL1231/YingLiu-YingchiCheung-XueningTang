## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, setup}
getwd()

library(dplyr)
library(cowplot)
library(lubridate)
```


```{r, read data}

population<-read.csv("./data/population2011-2022.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

water.withdraw<-read.csv("./data/EDA final data_water.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

water.discharge<-read.csv(
  "./data/EDA_final project_wastewater_discharge.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

```{r, data wrangling}
#1.First step eliminate the extra column in data set and convert it into format we need.
durh_pop <- 
  population %>%
  filter(Year==2012|Year==2013|Year==2014|Year==2015
         |Year==2016|Year==2017|Year==2018|Year==2019
         |Year==2020|Year==2021) %>%
  mutate(Change_Percentage = Change..)%>%
  select(Year,Population,Change_Percentage) 

#2.Next join the tables together as our main data frame to conduct results.
water_final <- left_join(water.discharge, water.withdraw, by = c("Year", "Month"))

pop_water_final <- full_join(durh_pop,water_final)#main data frame to draw line charts

pop_water_summaries <- 
  pop_water_final %>%
  group_by(Year, Population) %>%
  summarise(mean.discharge = mean(Monthly.Discharge.Wastewater), 
            sd.discharge = sd(Monthly.Discharge.Wastewater), 
            mean.withdraw = mean(Monthly.Water.Withdraw), 
            sd.withdraw = sd(Monthly.Water.Withdraw))
#sub-data frame to draw boxplots

```

```{r, saving data}
write.csv(pop_water_final, row.names = FALSE, file = "./data/Durham_water&population_2012-2021.csv")
write.csv(pop_water_summaries, row.names = FALSE, file = "./data/Durham_county_water_withdraw&diacharge_summary.csv")
```

```{r, line charts}

```

```{r, boxplots}
